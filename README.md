- This is a web app I wrote in March-April 2024.
The api folder has all the backend(server-side) code.
The client folder has all the frontend(client-side) code.
The server-side code is written in JavaScript. The client-side code is written with ReactJS, JavaScript, and CSS
style sheets.
Video demonstration of the app: https://youtu.be/a2Tx6ue__hc
* I made a few improvements after recoridng the video. For example, the pictures of the products are not in the same size in the video, but they are with the changes in css file.
Webside address: https://instacoffee.vercel.app/
* This webisite may not work after May 2024 because the online server, the external APIs might stop working, etc. I did add many error-proof measures to prevent the website from crashing in the event of some components not working.
